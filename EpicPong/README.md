# Epic Pong
This project was the game pong along with a bot to play as the oponent.
I used SpriteKit to make this game and it helped me learn how Xcode handles games.
I have used Unity before as a Game engine which uses C# (Microsoft Java) which I am much more used too.
Since the basis of pong is a ball that bounces around, I tried to use the physics code in swift.
I got it working with sketchy velocity manipulation and probably could of done it in a better way.
I like the way Unity handles physics alot better.

### Learnt
* SpriteKit for games
* Physics in swift (sorta)
* Basic game states

### Time Spent
Around 3 days
