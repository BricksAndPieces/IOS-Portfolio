# Marble Maze
This is app was supposed to be my first app on the app store. 
It was a marble maze that infinitely generates downwards with increasing difficulty the further you go.
You control the marble by tilting your device in the direction you want the marble to go.
This was done by changing the direction of gravity which was alot more intuitive than adding  a force to the marble.
I also improved my physics code from the Pong App for the marble.  

Most of the time was spent on optimizing the maze generation.
Generating a maze was relatively easy because I had created my own implementation in java using depth first search.
All I had to do was transfer that code to swift.
The major issue came from creating sprites with hitboxs to act as walls in the maze based of the layout generated by my algorithm.
When the maze got too big, there would be thousands on sprite nodes which lagged out the game.
I solved this problem by creating another algorithm that connected boxes together horizonatally or vertically.
This reduced the number of nodes by nearly 90% which really helped performance.  

Unfortunately, after all my work, I learnt that the game wasn't really that fun to play.
I decided to drop the project and start something new because I didn't want to spend any longer on it.
The game is in a playable state and no bugs have been detected (yet).
