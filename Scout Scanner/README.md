# Scout Scanner
This app was a app that I was making for my FIRST Robotics team.
It was an IOS version for our existing scouting app that helped us scout our matches for potential alliance members.
This involved working with firebase which I had never done before.
It was relatively easy in swift and I got it implemented pretty quick.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to access the firebase console on the school mac which stopped the whole project.
I don't have another apple device to configure the firebase so this project is on hold.
