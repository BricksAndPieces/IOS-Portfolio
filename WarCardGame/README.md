# War Card Game
This project was my first ios project.
It was an app that simulated the playing of the card game war.
It was made following a CodingWithChris tutorial.
Although there isn't much code in this project, it helped me learn how to use XCode and swift.
I also learned how to make UI in a ViewController and make it scale according to device size.
