# IOS-Portfolio
A portfolio of all my IOS and swift shenanigans that I created in IOS Development.
All projects are linked below with the state of completeness (more info availible in project readme's).
This repository includes all my projects that I made in XCode using swift in class.
Some projects are really cool and other projects are garbage. They are all here.  
  
Note: Other IOS projects that were made after this class will also be linked below but are not part of this repository.
