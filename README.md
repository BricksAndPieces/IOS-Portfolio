# IOS-Portfolio
A portfolio of all my IOS and swift shenanigans that I created in IOS Development.
All projects are linked below with the state of completeness (more info availible in project readme's).
This repository includes all my projects that I made in XCode using swift in class.
Some projects are really cool and other projects are garbage. They are all here.  
  
Note: Other IOS projects that were made after this class will also be linked below but are not part of this repository.

### Who am I?
My name is Ishan Shetty and I am a junior at Eden Prairie High School.
I like Computer Science and know a variety of languages such as java, javascript, python, C#, and more recently, swift.
I mainly program in java and have a lot of other repositiories with java projects such as a [Neural Network that learns to play Snake using a Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/BricksAndPieces/Neural-Network-Framework), [Various Pathfinding Algorithms (with Maze Generation)](https://github.com/BricksAndPieces/PathFinding), and a [Flocking Simulation (with Quadtree implementation)](https://github.com/BricksAndPieces/Boids-Ecosystem) to name a few. All my projects can be found on [github](https://github.com/BricksAndPieces?tab=repositories). Some of my projects can are also viewable on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4hKlJOW9oR7HF80PxTBaew).
