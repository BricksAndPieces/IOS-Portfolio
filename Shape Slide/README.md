# Shape Slide (WIP)
Shape Slide is the project that I am currently working on. 
It is expected to be my first app to be put on the app store.
It is a puzzle game based of a prototype created in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxEg_Dr2utc).
Each puzzle is a grid with some shapes on it and the goal is to be left with only one shape.
There are currently 27 levels.  

More will be added to this readme as the app progresses
