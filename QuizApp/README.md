# Quiz App
This is my first actual app. It is a quiz app that pulls from a trivia api for its questions.
Since I used an API, I was able to get a large amount of questions for the app.
The app has thousands of questions and over 25 categories of questions.
Making this app helped teach me about using API's with swift along with parsing JSON.
Working with JSON is alot easier in swift then it is in other languages.
I also learnt how to have more than one view and pass data between them. 
This project is finished but remains in a slightly buggy state.

### Learnt
* Using API's in swift
* Parsing JSON in swift
* Using multiple View Controllers
* Passing data between View Controllers
* Adding sound effects to an app
* Putting an app on Testflight for testing
* Making an app icon for the app

### Time Spent
Around 1 week
